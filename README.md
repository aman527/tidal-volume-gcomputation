# tidal-volume-gcomputation
Python translations of R code using g-computation to determine better mechanical ventilation treatment strategies for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

It's well-established that lung-protective treatment strategies improve survival rates, and driving pressure has been identified as the crucial variable in these strategies. However, the best way to modify driving pressure is not yet clear. This project aims to determine optimal strategies for modulating tidal volume to achieve target driving pressure values, with the end goal of improving patient outcomes.
